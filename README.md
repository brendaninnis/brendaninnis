I am a lifelong learner. I get great joy from learning and applying some new knowledge or skill.

## Side Projects
###### These are a few things I have done in my spare time, and that I am proud to share with others. All projects source code are available in my public repositories.

### Reality Dice

Reality Dice is an Augmented Reality iOS App that lets you roll realistic polyhedral 3D dice in your physical envrionment. Dice can collide with real world objects in your environment, use realistic physics and have authentic sound effects. You can view the results of your rolls through your device camera and see it calculated in the UI. It can be downloaded on the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reality-dice/id6460648236).

### Daily Fat Counter - iOS and Android Apps

Daily Fat Counter is an app I created for my wife. She was required to be on a fat-restricted diet, and Daily Fat Counter helps people to manage their low fat diets by counting the amount of dietary fat you consume throughout each day. I developed the iOS app using Swift UI, and the Android app using Kotlin and Jetpack components. The apps are available for download on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1631074004) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.brendaninnis.dailyfatcounter).

### Satle - A Wordle-like Daily Geography Puzzle

Satle is a game built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as well as the Bootstrap library, where you have to guess the name of a city based on satellite images. After each incorrect guess, the image will zoom out and you will be shown the distance and direction from your guess to the answer city. I was inspired by the Wordle-like games my colleagues and I play in our #trivia Slack channel, Worldle and Heardle, and I decided to make my own game for us to play. I've had a lot of positive feedback and the site has attracted over 6000 users in it's first month. I hosted the game with Linode as a subdomain on the domain I use for my blog. Give it a try [here](https://satle.brendaninnis.ca).

### Local Networking Apps - Connecting Multiple Instances of an App Over LAN

I created a simple chat app that allows users to join a chat room with iOS and Android device over the LAN network. These apps are a demonstration of how to connect multiple instances of the same app over the local network using Bonjour network service discovery, TCP communication and the client-server model. I wrote blog posts explaining this process and shared these apps on my GitHub so others can learn how accomplish this for themselves in their own apps.
